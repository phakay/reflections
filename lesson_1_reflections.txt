How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?
- Ans:
It helped to show the lines that differs, making it easy to identify
the changes, hence the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
- Ans:
It helps keep track of changes, allowing me to compare and being able to revert 
to a stable or working state of my source file.
