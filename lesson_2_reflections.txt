What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When repository is initialized, git adds a hidden folder that contains metadata used to track
 the history and changes of files in the repository.
 It is done to ensure that git keeps track of your files.
 
How is the staging area different from the workind directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area contains files that are tracked and ready to be committed.
It helps to provide an intermediate stage between the working directory and what is committed.
It also helps sort out files that would be added to commit from the ones that will not in the 
working folder.
