What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- When repository is initialized, git adds a hidden folder that contains metadata used to track
 the history and changes of files in the repository.
 It is done to ensure that git keeps track of your files.
 
How is the staging area different from the workind directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area contains files that are tracked and ready to be committed.
It helps to provide an intermediate stage between the working directory and what is committed.
It also helps sort out files that would be added to commit from the ones that will not in the 
working folder.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 - The staging area contains the most recent commit until a change is added.
 when a change is made and added to the staging area. I can compare the files in the staging
 with files in the most recent commit. This allows me to see what changes is made 
 with respect to what is already on the repository. By doing so, I ensure the change i'm adding
 is a logical change before commiting.
