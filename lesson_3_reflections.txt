When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- I would want to make my work on local repository globally accessible for collaboration with others.
- It makes it flexible to work on your code since you don't have to always depend on using your computer to access your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- It's convinient to chose when add commits from a remote repo to local because it ensures
commits aren't disorganised since the remote repo might contain commits from other members.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?
- Forks is simply making a copy of an existing repo along with a form of reference to the parent repo.
it's a feature that can only be accessed in github.
Clone is also a form of making a copy of a remote repo and copying it to your local storage.
it's a feature used in git.
Branch is one or a collection of commits that share a coomon <head> and reference eachother.
it is also a feature used in git.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- It helps to compare changes in your local repo with that in the remote repo.
it also helps to carryout the comparism even while offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be
harder?
- To collaborate without git or GitHub, i'd imagine organising different versions of code of a project
in a folder then putting them in a zip package. However, this would also be difficult to maintain.
Using git and github makes collaborating a lot easier as u don't have to worry about 
distance barriers and differences in opinions.
