When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- I would want to make my work on local repository globally accessible for collaboration with others.
- It makes it flexible to work on your code since you don't have to always depend on using your computer to access your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- It's convinient to chose when add commits from a remote repo to local because it ensures
commits aren't disorganised since the remote repo might contain commits from other members.
